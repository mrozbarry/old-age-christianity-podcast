  "description": "A podcast about our lives as Jesus-following Christians. We emphasize using scripture alone, salvation through faith alone, by grace alone, through Christ Jesus alone, to the glory of God alone. We believe Jesus was the fullness of God embodied in a man, fully God and fully man. We also want to discuss the infiltration of new age thought and practices into Christianity - the title being a pun in that we support old age Christianity.",
